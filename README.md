# TWizard's Unity Framework

General framework I use for my Unity projects.

## Examples

### ScriptableObjectSingleton

A singleton for *ScriptableObjects*, useful for project settings located in *Resources*.

## Add to your project

In your Unity project inside the *Packages* folder modify your manifest.json and a line in the *dependencies* field:

```json
"com.twizard.framework": "https://github.com/tomi901/TWizard-Unity-Framework.git"
```
